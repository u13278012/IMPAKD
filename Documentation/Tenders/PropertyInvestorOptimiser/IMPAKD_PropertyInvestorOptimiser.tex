\item {\Large \underline{\textbf{Development Methodology}}}\\[0.2cm]
For this project, the following development methodology will be used:

	\begin{itemize}
 		\item \underline{Name:}
		\\[0.1cm]
		 Scrum
		\item  \underline{What is Scrum?}
		\\[0.1cm]
		Scrum is a lightweight management framework with broad applicability for managing \& controlling iterative \& 				incremental projects of all types (Takeuchi \& Nonaka, 1999).
		\item \underline{Why did we choose to use it?}
		\\[0.1cm]
		Because of all the potential additions that might occur at the different stages of development for this project, we 			have decided that Scrum is the best suited development methodology to use.
	\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\item {\Large \underline{\textbf{Keeping the Client Informed}}}\\[0.2cm]
To keep the client informed about the project, we are going to use the following technologies and strategies:

	\begin{itemize}
	\item During the client meetings where we are going to discuss all aspects of the project.
	\item Send email to set up appointments.
	\item Use an application called Slack for general queries and updates.
	\end{itemize} 

\bigskip
\item {\Large \underline{\textbf{Ideas to Solve Technical Problems for the Project}}}\\[0.2cm]
We are going to create a heuristic function to work out the optimal investment strategy depending on the usersâ€™ portfolio. 
	\begin{itemize}

	\item \underline{First Phase}

		\begin{enumerate}
		\item We will classify the type of property as either commercial or residential and have different algorithms to 				simulate the ROI for each. 
		\item We will then take into account the most likely property related expenses associated with that property such 			as operational expenses which include utility bills and repairs.
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\item \underline{Second Phase}

		\begin{enumerate}
		\item We will research APIs that wil help usl convert numerical data into statistical data to create graphs, charts, 				etc.
		\end{enumerate}

	\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\item {\Large \underline{\textbf{Possible Technologies to be Used}}}\\[0.2cm]
We are planning on using the following technologies for the project:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \underline {Version Control:} Git
		\\
		\item  \underline{Unit Testing:} JUnit Framework
		\\
		\item We will use Maven for dependency management, plugin framework and support for modularization for 				projects.
		\\
		\item For the implementation of the project, we will use a Model-View-Controller, or MVC architectural pattern with 			the help of Node.js and Ember.js.
	\end{itemize}

\bigskip
 \item {\Large \underline{\textbf{What the Client will Receive}}}\\[0.2cm]
In addition to the given project deliverables, the client will receive a potential Android application.

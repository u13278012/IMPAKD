%Project Execution
\section{Project Execution}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\large \underline{\textbf{Development Methodology}}}\\[0.2cm]
For this project, the following development methodology will be used:

	\begin{itemize}
 		\item \underline{Name:}
		\\[0.1cm]
		 Scrum
		\item  \underline{What is Scrum?}
		\\[0.1cm]
		Scrum is a lightweight management framework with broad applicability for managing \& controlling iterative \& 				incremental projects of all types (Takeuchi \& Nonaka, 1999).
		\item \underline{Why did we choose to use it?}
		\\[0.1cm]
		Because of all the potential additions that might occur at the different stages of development for this project, we 			have decided that Scrum is the best suited development methodology to use.
	\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\item {\large \underline{\textbf{Keeping Magna BC Informed}}}\\[0.2cm]
To keep the Magna BC informed about the project, we are going to use the following technologies and strategies:

	\begin{itemize}
	\item During the client meetings where we are going to discuss all aspects of the project.
	\item Send email to set up appointments.
	\item Use an application called Slack for general queries and updates.
	\end{itemize} 

\bigskip
\item {\large \underline{\textbf{Ideas to Solve Technical Problems for autoPerform}}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The data from all information sources should be sent to at the server in order to have it processed uniformly at a single point.
    \item The higher level performance areas can be specified as units of time. For example  they could measure a workers performance over a month, year or longer.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\item {\large \underline{\textbf{Possible Technologies to be Used}}}\\[0.2cm]
We are planning on using the following technologies for the project:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \underline {Version Control:} Git
		\\
		\item  \underline{Unit Testing:} JUnit Framework
		\\
		\item We will use Maven for dependency management, plugin framework and support for modularization for 				projects.
		\\
		\item \underline{Front-end (Xamarin):}
		\\[0.2cm]
		 We will use the REST model to send data to and from the mobile application.  The specific REST API framework we 			will use is GgaREST. It is free and easy to use. Xamarin allows us to create both Android and IOS applications using the same C# code.
	\mmmmmend{itemize}

\bigskip
 \item {\large \underline{\textbf{What Magna BC will Receive}}}\\[0.2cm]
Aside from the required delivarbles, we will also provide an Android and IOS application for the project.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
The Property Investment Optimiser's purpose is to assist the user by optimising their investments in the rental property space. The purpose of this document is to list the tests we have put in place to ensure the functionality of the project. Test driven development was used to ensure that we spend less time debugging the code while creating a detailed specification of what functionality is required for the project.

\subsection{Scope}
This document will be used to elaborate and substantiate the unit tests conducted for the various use
cases of the Property Investment Optimiser project. Unit test, with mock objects, will be used to ensure the correct functionality of each use case's implementation. These unit tests are done on the server side.

\subsection{Test Environment}
Junit was used to implement the tests for each test case. Also, EJBContainers were used to test functionality that requires JPA and Enterprise Java Beans.

\section{Detailed Test Results}
\subsection{Overview of Test Results}
<<<<<<< HEAD
The test that were done were mostly on the back-end.This is where we validate our values before they are inserted into the database.all the test we did passed even those that would cause the systems fail. This was done by handling the system failure correctly,anticipating what would go wrong and handling that failure in a correct way through try and catch blocks.The tests expected the system to fail and the error to be handled ,so once it it handled in the expected way, the test pass. Junit spring framework was used for unit testing in the backend. 

\subsection{Functional Requirements Test Results}
The tests we have created for this module are contained within the files   \href{https://github.com/u13278012/IMPAKD/blob/master/Implementation/PIO/BackEnd/test/Test/PropertyTest.java}{PropertyTest} and  \href{https://github.com/u13278012/IMPAKD/blob/master/Implementation/PIO/BackEnd/test/Test/ProfileTest.java}{ProfileTest} . and \href{https://github.com/u13278012/IMPAKD/}{gitHub}.
=======
The test that were done were mostly on the back-end.This is where we validate our values before they are inserted into the database.all the test we did passed even those that would normally cause the systems fail. This was done by handling the system failure correctly,anticipating what would go wrong and handling that failure in a correct way through try and catch blocks. Junit spring framework was used for unit testing in the back-end. The front-end test where done to the test the system in a wider scope because the front-end is dependent on the back-end.when a test that sends a request to the back-end passes, it also assures that the function in the back-end are working correctly.We used Karma and Jasmine framework to conduct unit test in javascript.

\section{Other}
The service contracts ensure that our tests would test that the functionality would return relevant and accurate data.
=======
\subsubsection{Test Case 6 (TC 4.6)}
The function returned true, hence it successfully persisted in the database
\paragraph{Result: Pass.}

The different use cases do allow for the application to be deployed into an application server because they cover all the functionality that is required of the application.
\section{Conclusions and Recommendations}
Test were done in the back-end to test for security features implemented as the application allows users to input data.Parameters are passed though the url to the back-end. So regardless of the validation we have in the font-end, malicious users might pass in  malicious code after the validation in the front-end through the url, so it is important for the application to handle both user errors and malicious code, the test have assured that the countermeasures implemented work correctly.
